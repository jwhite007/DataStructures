DataStructures
==============

A repository for modules such as linked lists, stacks, etc.... to be used in projects for Code Fellows Python Bootcamp.

linked_list.py
  Implements a linked list with insert, pop, remove, size, search, and print functions.  Added a print_kth_from_nth
  fucntion on March 28, 2014.

stack.py
  Implements an infinite stack with push and pop methods.  Pop returns an error when attempted on empty list.
  
queue.py
  Implements an infinite queue with enqueue, dequeue, and size methods.  Dequeue returns an error message when attempted
  on an empty list.
  
hash_table.py
  Implements a hash table with set-node-value, get-node-value, and and a hash helper function.
  
mylib.py
  Stores days of the week in a hash table and recalls them based on a factory function which is created by inputing a year
  and a month.  The generated function can then be used to show what day of the week a certain day was on the input year
  and month.
  
bst.py
  Implements a binary search tree with insert, contains, size, depth, check_balance, remove-node functions as well as
  functions for tree traversal.... in-order, pre-order, post-order, depth-first, and breadth-first.
  
insort.py
  Implements an insert-sort algorithm
  
msort.py
  Implements a merge-sort algorithm
  
qsort.py
  Implements a quick-sort algorithm
  
rsort.py
  Implements a radix-sort algorithm
